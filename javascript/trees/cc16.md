# Trees

A tree is a node class with a root, left and right values. The tree works its way down the left side until it can no longer find a left, when it does this it will look right and if there is no right it will go back up and repeat this process. This is just the path that is used to traverse a tree. Trees are used in many places such as file structure and DOM, maybe even canvas assignments too?

## Challenge

Create a method that finds the node with the highest value in a tree and create tests to prove that the function works.

## Approach & Efficiency

Tyler drove throughout the code challenge and we started off with the whiteboard, filled in the problem domain, visualization etc. We then worked on the algorithm and tweaked our previous code from code challenge 15 to create a function to find the max value. We then put our code into our vscode and created tests to make sure they worked.

## API

I have created a method for treeMax that will find the max value in a tree as well as a test that tests each node as the function is traversing to check if the max value changes when it should.
