# treeSum

A tree is a node class with a root, left and right values. The tree works its way down the left side until it can no longer find a left, when it does this it will look right and if there is no right it will go back up and repeat this process. This is just the path that is used to traverse a tree. Trees are used in many places such as file structure and DOM, maybe even canvas assignments too?

## Challenge

â€ƒWrite a function called treeSum taking in a tree. It will get the sum of all the values within the tree (just one I thought of that I thought would be fun)

## Approach & Efficiency

I first created a whiteboard with all necessary parts included. I then worked on the algorithm and wrote code to make treeSum work the way it should. I then put our code into our vscode and created tests to make sure they worked.

## API

I have created a method for treeSum that would take in a tree and return the sum of all the values within the tree.
