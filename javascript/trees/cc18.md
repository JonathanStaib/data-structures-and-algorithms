# BreadthFirst

A tree is a node class with a root, left and right values. The tree works its way down the left side until it can no longer find a left, when it does this it will look right and if there is no right it will go back up and repeat this process. This is just the path that is used to traverse a tree. Trees are used in many places such as file structure and DOM, maybe even canvas assignments too? TreeFizzBuzz is a way to check if your node values are divisible by 3 and/or 5.

## Challenge

Create a tree that checks whether each node is divisible by 3 and/or 5. Return fizz for divisible by 3 and buzz for divisible by 5. If both, return fizzBuzz

## Approach & Efficiency

We first created a whiteboard with all necessary parts included. We then worked on the algorithm and wrote code to make FizzBuzz work the way it should. We then put our code into our vscode and created tests to make sure they worked.

## API

I have created a method for FizzBuzz that should go through a tree and check if each value is divisible by 3 and/or 5. It will return fizz and/or buzz appropriately.
