## Approach & Efficiency

I followed along with Ryan's example from class to see the steps that needed to be taken just to get a feel for the process. I created the problem domain and assessed what needed to be done, I thought of what was going in as the input and what we wanted to come out as the output. Test cases was next in which i implemented what we may need to check along the way to see if we were on track to our goal. Next was the visualization which I didn't think would be as helpful as it actually was. When seeing the visualization beforehand it kind of just pops the code ideas into your head on its own which I found quite fascinating as I haven't had this experience with diagrams and code before. Next is the algorithm, typing out your code in english so it can be easier to type in code after. I also feel this can be a great skill being able to talk about your code in english can be tougher than it may seem to be. Next was just implementing your code based on your algorithm and making a step through diagram to show how the loop would go through each time. I feel that following these steps would be best, in future ones I may want to do visualization second after the problem domain but it will be partner code challenges and I will defintely have to ask with them first to see how they are feeling about that. I will keep it in mind though beecause I feel that it could help me before the test cases. `:)`
