# Code Challenge 41 Mock Interview

I haven't worked with linked lists for a while so I looked up some challenges online to see what I could work on. I am feeling comfortbal with trees and now quite a bit more comfortable with linked lists. I was thinking during this exercise of what questions I could ask during it to prepare myself better for my interview final tomorrow and I am feeling less anxious about it after this exercise.
