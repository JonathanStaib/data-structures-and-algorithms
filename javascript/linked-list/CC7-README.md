# Linked List KTH

Find a number that is k-th value from the end of a linked list.

## Challenge

We needed to create a function that would find the kth nuumber from the end of the list and return it.

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach that we took as a class was to first create our whiteboard with our algorithm, code, visualization, problem domain, etc. Then we moved on to putting the code from our whiteboard into our code itself. We created tests around this code to see if it would work off bat and it did not. We needed to change one small thing in there and it was just from `return current` to `return current.value` The big O for both time is O(n) and space is O(1).
